                        <h3>Birth & Early Childhood</h3>
                        <p>On the 1st of July, 1943, in the heart of Bunyala Central, Busia County, a precious life was born: Mama Virginia Taka Ong’udi. She was the beloved daughter of the late Adrian Ouma and the late Elizabeth Ogusini, who nurtured her in faith, love, and the values that shaped her lifelong journey.</p>
                        <p>Mama Virginia grew up in a close-knit family and shared her childhood with her siblings, the late Angeline Nakori, the late Clementina Juma, the late Okhidi, the late Magdaline Anyango, and the late Raphael Bwebwe. Together, they built bonds of laughter, resilience, and kinship that carried her through life.</p>
                        <p>Her early years laid the foundation for the remarkable woman she became—strong in spirit, compassionate at heart, and deeply rooted in family and faith.</p>

                        <h3>Marriage & Family Life</h3>
                        <p>In 1956, Mama Virginia was joined in holy matrimony to the late Jacob Casper Ong’udi, a union blessed with five wonderful children: Consolata Night Omutiti, Romanus Ochiogo, Chrispinus Ong’udi, Priscilla Ogusini, and her youngest, Samuel Ong’udi. She also lovingly embraced her role as co-wife to Angelina Nafula and stepmother to the late Joseph Odonyi, Jecinta Wilhemina, and Brenck.</p>
                        <p>As a mother-in-law, she welcomed Johnstone Omutiti, Ouma, the late Florence Nabwire, and Esther Millicent Ouma into the family with warmth and respect. She cherished her wider family bonds, standing as a sister-in-law to the late Buluma, Were, and Christopher Ochiogo.</p>
                        <p>Mama Virginia’s greatest pride was her legacy as grandmother to 22 beloved grandchildren and 21 step-grandchildren, and as great-grandmother to 30 beautiful great-grandchildren and 21 step-great-grandchildren—all of whom were touched by her love, prayers, and wisdom.</p>

                        <h3>Christian Life</h3>
                        <p>Mama Virginia Taka Ong’udi was a devoted Catholic, faithfully worshipping and serving at St. Cajetan Sirimba Catholic Church. She found joy in prayer, fellowship, and the sacraments, always encouraging her family to walk in faith.</p>
                        <p>Even in her final days, her unwavering faith stood as a beacon of strength and courage to her family. Mama’s Christian journey was a testimony of hope, trust in God’s providence, and steadfast devotion to the Catholic faith.</p>

                        <h3>Illness & Death</h3>
                        <p>On 31st August 2025, Mama Virginia Taka Ong’udi suddenly collapsed at her home. She was rushed to Nyambare Mission Hospital and later transferred to Nangina Hospital. The following day, 1st September 2025, she was admitted at Siaya County Referral Hospital.</p>
                        <p>Despite the tireless efforts of doctors and the fervent prayers of her family, Mama’s condition worsened. A CT scan revealed severe brain damage caused by lack of oxygen. After three days on life support, on the quiet morning of 5th September 2025, our beloved Mama peacefully answered the call of her Maker.</p>
                        <p>Her departure has left a void that can never be filled, but we find comfort in the Word of God:</p>
                        <p><em>Revelation 21:4<br>“He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.”</em></p>
                        <p>Though our hearts are broken, we rejoice that Mama has found eternal rest in the arms of the Lord.</p>
